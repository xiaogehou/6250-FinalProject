# Flight tickets website

This is a complete website integrated with easy front page, backend APIs supported by sample datas saved in Mysql database.


## Project Summary
My project is a website of searching and buying air tickets for customers, and managing flights for admin. For the data basics, I designed models for user side including User, Customer and Authority, models for flight side including Airliner, Airplane, Flight and Seat.
